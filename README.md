# HostelPulse 🏨

HostelPulse is a hostel issue management platform designed to streamline communication between hostel residents and administrators. The system allows students to report hostel-related issues easily, while administrators can manage and resolve complaints efficiently.

The platform ensures better transparency, faster resolution of problems, and improved hostel management.

## 📌 Project Overview

In many hostels, students face problems such as maintenance issues, electricity failures, water supply problems, or sanitation issues. These complaints are often reported informally which leads to delays and poor tracking.

HostelPulse solves this problem by providing a centralized digital platform where:

- Students can submit complaints online
- Complaints can be categorized and tracked
- Administrators can monitor and resolve issues
- Users can track the status of their complaints

This system improves communication and accountability between students and hostel authorities.
